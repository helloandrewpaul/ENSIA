ENISA, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, produces an annual report called the ENISA Threat Landscape (ETL) report. The latest edition, released in October 2022, covers the period from April 2021 to July 2022. Here's a summary of the key findings from the report:

**Top Threats:**
1. **Ransomware**: Many organizations affected by ransomware have paid ransom demands.
2. **Malware**: A significant number of zero-day vulnerabilities were disclosed in 2021.
3. **Social Engineering**: Phishing remains popular, with new variants emerging like spear-phishing, whaling, smishing, and vishing.
4. **Threats against Data**: Increasing in proportion to the total volume of data produced.
5. **Threats against Availability**: The largest DDoS attack ever was launched in Europe in July 2022, affecting availability.
6. **Disinformation â€“ Misinformation**: Escalating AI-enabled disinformation, deepfakes, and disinformation-as-a-service.
7. **Supply Chain Targeting**: Third-party incidents accounted for a significant portion of intrusions in 2021 compared to the previous year.

**Main Trends:**
1. **Zero-Day Exploits**: Used by threat actors to achieve their goals.
2. **Hacktivism**: A new wave observed since the Russia-Ukraine war.
3. **DDoS Attacks**: Growing larger and more complex, targeting mobile networks and IoT devices.
4. **AI-Enabled Disinformation and Deepfakes**: Proliferation of bots modeling personas disrupting processes and interactions.

ENISA's reports provide valuable insights into the evolving cybersecurity threat landscape in Europe and beyond, helping organizations and policymakers understand and mitigate cyber risks effectively.
